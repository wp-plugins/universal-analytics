We would like to give special credit to Audrius Dobilinskas.  Our plugin is based on his version of [Google Universal Analytics](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-universal-analytics) which provides several more advanced features as well as being able to use the "Classic" version of Google Analytics as well as being able to add your own custom snippets.  

Our version of Universal Analytics has been modified and trimmed down to meet our specific needs and supports integration with [Launch Check](http://wordpress.org/plugins/launch-check).  If you're not familiar with it, Launch Check ensures you have made your site visible to search engines, changed the default description and added Google Analytics before launch.
